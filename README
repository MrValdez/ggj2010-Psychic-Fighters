This is my first global game jam game I've ever created. Its called Psychic Fighters.

The theme for 2010 is "Deception". We've decided to make a game where the players are "psychic" and can sense their opponent's attack.

The game is played by two players (there's no AI). Controls for Overhead and Uppercut are as follows: Player 1 - W and D; Player 2 - Up and Down.

**Code**

This is the first time I made a non-demo game in python and pygame. Frankly, I am quite embarrased by my code. But everyone have to start somewhere.

The most embarrasing thing I've done is mix spaces and tabs. Well, it worked on python 2.6, so I didn't noticed until I needed to show off the game and it didn't work on newer python versions.


(more information about the game will be post later. I'm still writing it)
